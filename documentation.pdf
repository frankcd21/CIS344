Changes Made to the Header:
Moved the Header to the Middle:
Initially, the header (<header>) was left-aligned. I modified the CSS to center the header content, which includes the logo and the driving school name.
In style.css, I added the following styles:
header {
    text-align: center;
    margin-top: 20px;
}
This ensures the logo and title are placed in the center of the page, improving the design by providing a balanced visual experience.
Logo Size Adjustments:
The logo image was originally set to height="70" and width="70". I decided to slightly increase the size to give the logo more prominence:
<img src="logo.jpeg" alt="Driving School logo" height="90" width="90" />
This small change helps the logo become more noticeable and better represents the brand.
Title Color Change:
To make the title of the driving school stand out more, I changed the color of the <h1> element by modifying the style:
h1 {
    color: #007BFF; /* Changed from black to a bold blue */
    font-size: 28pt; /* Increased size slightly */
}
The blue color is bright, friendly, and aligns with a professional driving school's theme.
Changes in Color Scheme:
Updated Menu Item Colors:
The previous menuitem design used a plain black or gray color for the text. I updated the menu links to have a more vibrant hover effect:
.menuitem a:hover {
    background-color: #f1f1f1;
    color: #007BFF; /* Added hover color change */
}
This interactive feedback improves the user experience and makes the navigation more modern.
Card Backgrounds and Buttons:
I enhanced the card visuals by adding a light blue color to make them stand out:
.card {
    background-color: #e6f7ff; /* Light blue */
    border: 2px solid #007BFF;
}
The buttons were also updated to have a hover effect with a slightly darker green color:
.card a:hover {
    background-color: #218838;
}
These changes make the content more visually engaging and consistent with the site's theme.
Adding Cards and Pricing Information
One of the key features I introduced was the lesson plans displayed as cards in both home.html and bookings.html. Each card contains a title, price, and description of the driving lesson plans. Here’s how I implemented these cards:
HTML Structure: I created a card layout using a combination of div elements for styling and organization. Each card is wrapped in a div with the class card.
Content: Inside each card, I included relevant information such as the plan name, price, and a brief description. This allows users to quickly understand what each plan offers.
<div class="card">
    <h3>Basic Plan</h3>
    <p class="price">$250</p>
    <p class="description">5 lessons with a certified instructor. Perfect for beginners to learn the fundamentals.</p>
    <a href="#">Sign Up</a>
</div>
CSS Styling: The cards were styled using CSS to ensure they have a consistent look. This includes background colors, borders, and hover effects to enhance user interaction.
.card {
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
    border-radius: 10px;
    width: 250px;
    padding: 20px;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
    text-align: center;
    margin: 10px;
}

.card a {
    text-decoration: none;
    color: white;
    background-color: #28a745; /* Green button color */
    padding: 10px 20px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    font-size: 14pt;
    display: inline-block;
}

.card a:hover {
    background-color: #218838; /* Darker green on hover */
}
Adding FAQs Section
To provide additional support and information to users, I added a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section in faq.html. This section helps address common queries and offers guidance about the driving school’s services.
HTML Structure: Each FAQ is presented as a div with the class faq-item. This structure ensures that each question and answer is visually distinct and easy to read.
Content: The FAQs cover various topics such as age requirements, payment methods, and lesson cancellation policies, providing users with essential information at a glance.
Example FAQ Code:
<div class="faq-item">
    <h3>1. What age do I need to be to start driving lessons?</h3>
    <p>Students can start taking driving lessons at the age of 16.</p>
</div>
Styling: The FAQ items are styled to have a light background and rounded borders, which enhances readability and makes the information easily accessible.
CSS Example for FAQs:
.faq-item {
    background-color: #f9f9f9;
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 10px 0;
    padding: 15px;
}

.faq-item h3 {
    font-size: 16pt;
    color: #333;
}

.faq-item p {
    font-size: 14pt;
    color: #555;
    margin: 5px 0 0 0;
}

Challenges Encountered:
Centering the Header:
Initially, I had issues with centering the entire header due to the combination of the image and text being treated separately. I resolved this by applying text-align: center to the <header> tag, ensuring both the logo and the school name were centered together. It took a bit of trial and error to figure out the proper solution.
Cross-Browser Compatibility:
One challenge I faced was ensuring the changes looked consistent across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, and Edge). The CSS rendering was slightly off in Firefox, especially the buttons' hover effects. I had to adjust margins and padding slightly to fix this:
.card a {
    margin: 0 auto;
    display: inline-block;
}
This ensured proper alignment and uniform behavior on all major browsers.
CSS File Conflicts:
Another issue was conflicting CSS between the main style.css file and inline styles in bookings.html. I resolved this by consolidating styles and removing redundant inline styling to ensure everything was controlled through the central stylesheet. This improved maintainability and reduced the potential for styling conflicts.


Final Remarks:
The changes made provide a cleaner, more visually appealing design while improving the user experience through interactive elements. These adjustments, especially in the header and color scheme, help create a more professional and modern website for DAN Driving School. . The addition of lesson cards and an FAQ section not only enhances user engagement but also provides valuable information to prospective students.  Challenges around cross-browser consistency and layout adjustments were resolved, ensuring the site performs well across different devices and browsers.
